# gofiber-surrealdb-template
CleanArchitecture template for GoFiber with SurrealDB.

SurrealDB has high level interface, so we don't need to write the backend server so much but not none.

You can test this API with Insomnia by importing ```Insomnia_YYYY-MM-DD.yaml```.

## Quickstart
```
docker-compose up
```

## TODO
 - [ ] TikV Cluster
